### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- API & Cache

### What I learned

This project made my interaction with api's easier, it also gave me the challenge of working with fetch using the cache to make the project more fluid for the user, within script.js we have the version I made without help, but every time I clicked on the button it makes a new request, then the code was updated to leave the request in cache. ðŸ˜Š
